# TensorFlow Internals
## How does TensorFlow internally map an operation in computational graph to the corresponding registered C++ operation?
### Operation Registration in C++:
TensorFlow uses the `REGISTER_OP` macro to register operations. This registration includes the operation's name, input types, output types, and shape functions.
```C++
REGISTER_OP("Add")
    .Input("a: T")
    .Input("b: T")
    .Output("sum: T")
    .Attr("T: {float, double, int32, int64} = DT_FLOAT")
    .SetShapeFn([](shape_inference::InferenceContext* c) {
        shape_inference::ShapeHandle shape;
        TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->MergeInputShapes(0, 1, &shape));
        c->set_output(0, shape);
        return Status::OK();
    });
```

#### How REGISTER_OP Works
* Parsing the Macro: When `REGISTER_OP` is invoked, it parses the provided operation name, inputs, outputs, attributes, and shape function.
* Creating the `OpDef`: TensorFlow creates an `OpDef` structure that describes the operation based on the information provided in `REGISTER_OP`.
* Adding to Registry: The `OpDef` is added to TensorFlow's global operation registry, making the operation available for use in both Python and C++ code.
* Shape Inference: If a shape inference function is provided, it is used to compute the shapes of the output tensors during graph construction.

### Kernel Registration:
TensorFlow uses the `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` macro to register the implementation of the operation for different devices (e.g., CPU, GPU).
```C++
REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("Add").Device(DEVICE_CPU), AddOp);
REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("Add").Device(DEVICE_GPU), AddOpGpu);
```

### Kernel Implementation:
Each kernel implements the actual computation of the operation. This is done by overriding the Compute method of the OpKernel class.
```C++
class AddOp : public OpKernel {
public:
    explicit AddOp(OpKernelConstruction* context) : OpKernel(context) {}

    void Compute(OpKernelContext* context) override {
        const Tensor& a = context->input(0);
        const Tensor& b = context->input(1);
        Tensor* sum = nullptr;
        OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output(0, a.shape(), &sum));

        auto a_flat = a.flat<float>();
        auto b_flat = b.flat<float>();
        auto sum_flat = sum->flat<float>();

        for (int i = 0; i < a_flat.size(); ++i) {
            sum_flat(i) = a_flat(i) + b_flat(i);
        }
    }
};
```

### Graph Construction:
TensorFlow constructs a GraphDef from the Python code. Each operation in the Python code corresponds to a node in the GraphDef, with the operation's name matching the registered C++ operation name.
```pbtxt
node {
    name: "Add"
    op: "Add"
    input: "a"
    input: "b"
    attr { key: "T" value { type: DT_FLOAT } }
}
```

### Graph Execution:
* During execution, TensorFlow uses the GraphDef protocol buffer, which contains serialized information about the computational graph, including operation types and dependencies.
* The TensorFlow executor reads the GraphDef and uses the operation names (e.g., "Add") to find the corresponding C++ implementation.

#### Operation Lookup:
* When TensorFlow executes the graph, it looks up the operation name ("Add") in its registry to find the corresponding C++ OpKernel implementation.
* TensorFlow maintains a registry of all operations and their kernels. This registry maps operation names to their corresponding OpKernel classes.
  ```C++
  static std::map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<OpKernel>> kernel_registry;
  ```

#### Kernel Invocation:
* The TensorFlow executor invokes the Compute method of the OpKernel class associated with the operation name. This method performs the actual computation.
  ```C++
  OpKernel* kernel = kernel_registry["Add"].get();
  kernel->Compute(context);
  ```


# TensorFlow and MLIR
To optimize a TensorFlow graph using MLIR, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Parse the TensorFlow graph: Use a library like TensorFlow's GraphDef parser to load the graph from the provided pbtxt format into a format that can be manipulated by MLIR.

2. Convert the TensorFlow graph to MLIR: Write a converter that translates the TensorFlow graph into MLIR. This involves mapping TensorFlow operations to corresponding MLIR operations and handling any differences in semantics or representation between the two.

3. Optimize the MLIR graph: Once you have the TensorFlow graph represented in MLIR, you can use MLIR's optimization passes to improve its performance. MLIR provides a variety of passes for common optimizations such as constant folding, dead code elimination, and loop optimization.

4. Convert the optimized MLIR graph back to TensorFlow: Finally, convert the optimized MLIR graph back to TensorFlow's representation if needed. This step may involve writing a reverse converter that maps MLIR operations back to TensorFlow operations.

Here's a high-level overview of what the code might look like:
```C++
// Assume you have parsed the TensorFlow graph into 'graphDef' and 'context' is your MLIR context.

// Create an MLIR module to hold the graph.
mlir::OwningModuleRef module(mlir::ModuleOp::create(mlir::UnknownLoc::get(&context)));

// Convert the TensorFlow graph to MLIR.
convertTensorFlowToMLIR(graphDef, context, module);

// Optimize the MLIR graph.
optimizeMLIR(module.get());

// Convert the optimized MLIR graph back to TensorFlow if needed.
convertMLIRToTensorFlow(module.get(), optimizedGraphDef);
```

Note that writing the `convertTensorFlowToMLIR`, `optimizeMLIR`, and `convertMLIRToTensorFlow` functions would require a deep understanding of both TensorFlow and MLIR, as well as the ability to map operations and their semantics between the two frameworks.
